# Road-Accident-Analysis-in-Excel


Built With over 300K rows of demo-data and 21 fields, this dashboard is designed to provide in-depth insights into accident trends, casualties, and contributing factors. Using pivot tables and dynamic charts, I've created a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve road safety strategies. The dashboard includes filtering options based on accident date ranges and location settings (urban or rural). 

Here are some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) included in the dashboard: 

Total Casualties Overview 

Casualties by Severity and Vehicle Type 

Trend Analysis from 2021 to 2022 

Casualties by Road Surface Condition and Road Type 

Casualties by Light Condition during Accident (Daylight vs Darkness)
